# Squeak
Squeak is the built-in scripting language for Pia. It was chosen above existing languages as a way to minimise confusion 
regarding which features and versions of some proprietary language is supported. Hence, the Squeak interpreter shares 
its lifetime and release cycle with Pia. 

## Getting started
Pia is built for technical people, and the getting started guide of Squeak is too. Until an effort can be made to 
properly document the language in a more formal fashion the examples provided in the `examples/` subdirectory will have 
to do. Anyone who is comfortable with another scripting derivative of C (JavaScript?) should be able to pick it up 
rather quickly just from these examples. Besides, the idea is not to build huge codebases with Squeak, but rather to 
have it act as a glue for automation and testing.
