# Squeak
Squeak is the built-in scripting language for Pia. It was chosen above existing languages as a way to minimise confusion 
regarding which features and versions of some proprietary language is supported. Hence, the Squeak interpreter shares 
its lifetime and release cycle with Pia. 

The following document serves as a getting started guide for Squeak. More detailed and in-depth documentation should be 
created at some point before the first official release of Pia.
