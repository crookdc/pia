1. The open-source Postman alternative for technical people.

## Disclaimer
Even though this project presents itself as a Postman alternative it offers no guarantee to implement all features found 
in Postman. Though Postman has been the inspiration of user experience in several areas, Pia aims to be a tool that 
offers a user experience that can stand on its own two feet. Anyone is welcome to suggest the implementation of their 
favourite Postman features, but do not assume that just because Postman offers some feature that its in the roadmap for 
this project.

## State of Pia
The Pia project is still in **very** early development. There are no milestones or deadlines defined as there likely 
will never be any of the sort. Hopefully there will be alpha releases of Pia once development has reached a point where 
it can be used by the public in exchange for some feedback (not mandatory). You can of course clone and build Pia from 
source whenever you want but the quality of your experience cannot be guaranteed until an official release is created.
